      <ul>
          <p>Hello and God bless.</p>
        <li></li>
          <p>I am 34 years old and living in Miami, FL. 
        I was raised by Cuban immigrants and married a Cuban American. 
        I am a father of 3 beautiful children: 2 sons and 1 girl. 
        I have been married for 10 years and have been with my wife for 18 years.</p> 
        <li></li>
          <p>I am currently studying computer coding at UCF. 
        My previous schooling was at Miami Dade College School (MDC) of Film, Television & Digital Productions. 
        I studied many fields while at MDC within the Film school: Productions, Editing, Screenwriting & Special Effects. 
        I became very fluent and exceptional in Video & Sound Editing and was hired by Advanced Media Network to do just that. 
        I edited their weekly web shows, client videos & showcase videos, such as IFA.</p> 
        <li></li>
          <p>After a couple of years of that I had my first child and decided to step down and be a stay-at-home father. After that I had my other 2 kids. 
        Being a father has been my favorite career choice. I love taking care of them and playing with them.</p> 
        <li></li>
          <p>I am now ready for my next adventure as a professional, now that my kids are in school. 
        I am looking forward to learning computer coding at UCF and expanding my skills as a citizen of God's world.</p> 
        <li></li>
          <p>Amen.</p>
      </ul>
